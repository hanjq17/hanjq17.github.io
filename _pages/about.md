I am currently a first year PhD student at Stanford Computer Science. Previously, I obtained B.S. in Computer Science at Tsinghua University.

My core research interest lies in leveraging deep neural networks for modeling complex systems in physics and biochemistry, which is closely related to AI4Science.
I am particularly interested in geometrically equivariant GNNs which are powerful tools for learning interactions in complicated physical systems in a highly data-efficient fashion.

I am very fortunate to work with Prof. Wenbing Huang during my undergrad and Dr. Yu Rong at Tencent AI Lab. Welcome to reach me via email if you want to discuss or collaborate!
