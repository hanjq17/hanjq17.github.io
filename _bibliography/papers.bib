  abstract = 	 {Learning a shared policy that guides the locomotion of different agents is of core interest in Reinforcement Learning (RL), which leads to the study of morphology-agnostic RL. However, existing benchmarks are highly restrictive in the choice of starting point and target point, constraining the movement of the agents within 2D space. In this work, we propose a novel setup for morphology-agnostic RL, dubbed Subequivariant Graph RL in 3D environments (3D-SGRL). Specifically, we first introduce a new set of more practical yet challenging benchmarks in 3D space that allows the agent to have full Degree-of-Freedoms to explore in arbitrary directions starting from arbitrary configurations. Moreover, to optimize the policy over the enlarged state-action space, we propose to inject geometric symmetry, i.e., subequivariance, into the modeling of the policy and Q-function such that the policy can generalize to all directions, improving exploration efficiency. This goal is achieved by a novel SubEquivariant Transformer (SET) that permits expressive message exchange. Finally, we evaluate the proposed method on the proposed benchmarks, where our method consistently and significantly outperforms existing approaches on single-task, multi-task, and zero-shot generalization scenarios. Extensive ablations are also conducted to verify our design.}

abstract={Anomaly detection is a crucial task for monitoring various status (i.e., metrics) of entities (e.g., manufacturing systems and Internet services), which are often characterized by multivariate time series (MTS). In practice, it's important to precisely detect the anomalies, as well as to interpret the detected anomalies through localizing a group of most anomalous metrics, to further assist the failure troubleshooting. In this paper, we propose InterFusion, an unsupervised method that simultaneously models the inter-metric and temporal dependency for MTS. Its core idea is to model the normal patterns inside MTS data through hierarchical Variational AutoEncoder with two stochastic latent variables, each of which learns low-dimensional inter-metric or temporal embeddings. Furthermore, we propose an MCMC-based method to obtain reasonable embeddings and reconstructions at anomalous parts for MTS anomaly interpretation. Our evaluation experiments are conducted on four real-world datasets from different industrial domains (three existing and one newly published dataset collected through our pilot deployment of InterFusion). InterFusion achieves an average anomaly detection F1-Score higher than 0.94 and anomaly interpretation performance of 0.87, significantly outperforming recent state-of-the-art MTS anomaly detection methods.},
